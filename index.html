	<h3>Day 2</h3>
	<p>On Second day, we went to Sea World to see the aquatic life and all the marine animals. Also, we took all the spectacular roller coaster rides and 3-D rides. The Shamu show, dolphin show and Sea Lion & Sea otter show were breath-taking. It makes me feel that animals are no less than human-beings in intelligence. </p>
